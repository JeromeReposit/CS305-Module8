# CS305 Module 8

#Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for its customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial wants to modernize its operations. As a crucial part of the success of its custom software, the company also wants to use the latest and most effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API). The company is seeking Global Rain’s / myself about how to protect the organization from external threats.

#What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

Things that I did well when finding my client's software security vulnerabilities was manually review, static test, and recommended a mitigation plan. It is important to code securely so that you do not have any problems during the process and create satisfactory software. Software security proposes much value to the company's overall well-being because identified vulnerabilites can potentially harm the company in the future and mitigate potential success. 

#Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you

The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was after I ran the dependency check that it was difficult to distinguish what frameworks and libraries did what to the java application. The reason being that there were many dependencies and I did not have any prior knowledge. 

#How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

To increase the layers of security as I mentioned previously that I ran several tests inclduing reviewing the code. Planning to mitigate any identified security vulnerabilities in the software. Through these conducted tests, I was able to identify which libraries was most secure and implemented secure encryption mechanisms. It is correct to assess which is the proper techniques when considering the type of application that you are planning on creating.

#How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

To make certain the code and software applications were functional and secure you have to identify qualtiies in the code and structure of the software. Lack of input validation, missing access modifiers, error handling, injection attacks, and data exposure sensitivity are several factors that can potentially harm the code. After refactoring your code it is vital to rerun your testing of the software in order to mitigate any potential unwanted vulnerabilties. 

#What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Several resources, tools, and coding practices proved to be helpful for me in my assignments and tasks. The IDE eclipse paired with the maven project provided me with simple and functional project management. Resources such as using the internet to identify any questions that I had regarding coding or assignment rules helped in this manner.

#Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

What I might show to future employers regarding this assignment and the skills, knowledge, and experience that I accumulated would be my ability to adhere to client needs, identify areas of security, conduct tests, and interpret results.
